# Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis and Prediction

This project aims to analyze and predict whether a bank client will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic information, financial status, and previous interactions with the bankâ€™s marketing campaigns. By identifying patterns in the data, this project helps optimize marketing strategies and improve campaign success rates.

## Project Overview

This project involves:

- **Data Analysis**: Understanding the dataset and exploring relationships between variables.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Addressing the imbalance in the target variable using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).
- **Model Training**: Using Logistic Regression to classify clients as likely or unlikely to subscribe.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring the model's performance through metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

---

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing)
- **Description**: The dataset contains information about clients contacted as part of a bank marketing campaign. It includes 16 features, such as demographic information, financial status, and specifics of the latest contact.

---

## Objective

To develop a predictive model that classifies bank clients as likely or unlikely to subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic, financial, and interaction data.

---

## Key Challenges

- **Class Imbalance**: The dataset has significantly more non-subscribers (`"no"`) than subscribers (`"yes"`).
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for prediction.
- **Overfitting**: Ensuring the model generalizes well on unseen data.

---

## Steps and Implementation

### 1. Load the Data and Initial Inspection
- Load the dataset and inspect its structure using `df.info()`.
- Analyze and visualize relationships between features and the target variable (`y`).

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Use one-hot encoding for variables like `job`, `marital`, and `contact`.
- **Binary Mapping**: Convert binary variables like `housing` and `loan` to 0/1.
- **Scaling Numeric Features**: Standardize features like `age`, `balance`, and `duration` using `StandardScaler`.

### 3. Handle Class Imbalance
- Apply **SMOTE** to oversample the minority class (`"yes"`) in the training dataset.

### 4. Model Training
- Train a **Logistic Regression** model with and without class balancing.
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 5. Save Processed Data
- Save the cleaned and split data as `.csv` and `.npy` files for easy reuse.

## Results

### Key Metrics
| Metric               | Value (After SMOTE) |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Accuracy**         | 83%                |
| **Precision (Class 1)** | 38%              |
| **Recall (Class 1)**    | 81%              |
| **F1-Score (Class 1)**  | 52%              |

### Observations
- **Improved Recall**: The recall for the minority class improved significantly after applying SMOTE.
- **Balanced Detection**: The model can now effectively identify both subscribers and non-subscribers, although precision for subscribers has decreased.
